## Creating a New Event
To create a new event, organizers can follow these instructions:

1. Go to the [Create Event](https://www.meetup.com/nodeschoolnyc/schedule/) page on Meetup for NodeSchool NYC.
2. Select a new date and time. We generally have the meetup every second month on the second Wednesday.
3. Upload a featured image. You can most likely just use one from our Twitter account.
4. Add a description. See the reference description below.
5. Select a location. This is less static and may be filled in later in case we're still discussing where we're going to have it/working with locations.
6. Add all organizers as hosts. If any organizers need to opt out, they totally can.
7. Set an attendee limit of 45.
8. Do not allow guests. (Allowing Guests is challenging since many local venues require a list of all attendees beforehand.)

You can now save this event as a draft or publish it.

## Finalizing Events

There are a few things that many evnet spaces need. Here's a small list of things that we should add to as time goes on and we have more experiences with the things hosts request.

1. You can donwload the attendee list directly from Meetup. **Do not just send the list as it is when you download it.** It contains a suite of information about each attendee's meetup profile and NodeSchool NYC membership that event spaces don't need to have. The only columns that should be needed are: Name, Event Host, RSVP, and Full Name
  * This tool is not perfect. The Full Name column does not always pull all the data that exists. If there are many empty entries, you should double check them with the data that exists inside of meetup to ensure the Full Name collumn is as full as is humanly possible.
2. Ensure the week before and day of that everything is good with the event space. Generally they'll reach out to you but it's good to be proactive.
